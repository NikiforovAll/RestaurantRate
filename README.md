DataArt team project. 
The application allows users to find the best and most worthy restaurants in his city. The application consists of two parts. Together they provide all necessary functionality in terms of both user and administrator. The first is the admin panel, so all reviews are stored in a remote database and can be managed by admin through dashboard. Dashboard allows admins to add, delete, and modify all kinds of data. For example, when you add new review on particular restaurant you can specify name of restaurant, address, ratings on three different position and attach some photos. All this is done based on Entity FrameWork at the back-end and Bootstrap & jQuery at the front-end. Let's move onto the second part. Homepage includes main panel, map and user's marker. Map takes entire screen and displays user and nearby restaurants. It is worth noting that Google Maps provide clean and flexible API thus all features are associated with it. In addition, User can search restaurants and interact with them on the map. Panel slides down after clicking on the restaurant. It contains review, common information, gallery and comment section (VK widget). That's it!
 As result, our team have passed all base stages of software development life cycle and have acquired valuable experience in web development and teamwork.
